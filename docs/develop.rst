Make changes / additions
========================

Be sure to run and verify all examples! All existing examples should pass, while new examples should be added to document and check any new functionality.

Create a new release
====================

1.  Update the version number specified in ``GooseHDF5.h`` using ``HDF5PP_WORLD_VERSION``, ``HDF5PP_MAJOR_VERSION``, ``HDF5PP_MINOR_VERSION``.

2.  Upload the changes to GitHub and create a new release there (with the correct version number).
